## Contributing

While interest in contributing to this project is appreciated, it has been open
sourced solely for the purpose of sharing with the community. This means we are
unable to accept outside contributions at this time and pull requests will not
be reviewed or merged. To report a security concern or vulnerability, please
submit a GitHub issue.
```

## Copyrights

Source code contained within open source repositories must include the following copyright at the top of every file.

```
//
//  All Contributions by Match Group
//
//  Copyright © <years> <brand> (Match Group, LLC)
//
//  Licensed under the Match Group Modified 3-Clause BSD License.
//  See https://github.com/<organization>/<repository>/blob/main/LICENSE for license information.
//
```

> Replace `<years>`, `<brand>`, `<organization>` and `<repository>` with the correct values. The range of years starts the year that any code included in the project was first publicly available, followed by a hyphen (`-`) and ends with the current year. If the years are the same, for example if this is the first time the code is being open sourced, include only the current year (without a hyphen).

Here is a Tinder brand example:

```

//  Copyright © 2022-2023 Tinder (Match Group, LLC)
//
//  Licensed under the Match Group Modified 3-Clause BSD License.
//  See https://github.com/Tinder/Example/blob/main/LICENSE for license information.
